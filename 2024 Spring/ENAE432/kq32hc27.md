Force driving system is due to fan:
$$ f \req K_{f} \omega$$ where $K_{f}$ is constant, $\omega$ is rotation rate of fan.

Similarly:
$$ \omega \req k_{m} V_{m} $$
where $k_{m}$ constant, $V_{m}$ is voltage applied to motor
Then:

> [!NOTE]
> $$\ddot{y \left( t \right)} = K u \left( t \right), K = \left[ \frac{K_{f}K_{m}}{m} \right]$$

treating $V_{m}\left(t) = u\left(t\right)$ as the *input to the system*
