## $y$
- Distance of the location/cut of interest from equilibrium position
- $y_s$ is the _static_ $y$
- $y_d$ is the _dynamic_ $y$
- $\hat{y}$ is the _displacement_ $y$
  - Measured from static equilibrium position
  - $y = y_s + \hat{y}$

## $d$
- Distance of the body/system's movement from equilibrium position
- $y_R$ is the _relative displacement_ $y$
  - Measured from a given distance $d$
  - $y_R = y - d \to y = y_R + d$
