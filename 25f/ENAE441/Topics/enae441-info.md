## Course Goals

1. Provide a mathematical foundation to the field of state estimation
2. Use this foundation & pair it with knowledge of orbital mechanics + linear systems to estimate a spacecraft's orbit from noisy measurements

## Information this course builds on

- Orbits
- Linear Differential Equations (Linear Systems)
- Probability
- State Estimation

All of these come together to do Orbit Determination
