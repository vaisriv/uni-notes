## What is G.N.C.?

- Guidance, Navigation, and Control
- G.N.C. = Brains of spacecraft
- _or_ "Google Maps for Space"

## How do Maps work?

- Uses a series of steps:
    1. Idenitify candidate routes (guidance)
    2. Track current location (nav)
    3. Change your location (control)
- Of course, this all happens in a loop, refining and reworking the current plan to optimize each step

## Terrestrial vs. Space

- Reference: Planned Route = Spacecraft Trajectory
- Tracking: GPS = Space Navigation (what most of this class is about)
- Moving: Walking/Driving = [[25s/ENAE432|ENAE 432 - Controls]]
