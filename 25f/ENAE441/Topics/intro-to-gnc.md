## What is GNC?

- Guidance, Navigation, and Control
- GNC = Brains of spacecraft
- _or_ "Google Maps for Space"

## How do Maps work?

- Uses a series of steps:
  1. Idenitify candidate routes (guidance)
  2. Track current location (nav)
  3. Change your location (control)
- Of course, this all happens in a loop, refining and reworking the current plan to optimize each step

## Terrestrial vs. Space

- Reference: Planned Route = Spacecraft Trajectory
- Tracking: GPS = Space Navigation (what most of this class is about)
- Moving: Walking/Driving = [[25s/enae432 | ENAE 432 - Controls]]
