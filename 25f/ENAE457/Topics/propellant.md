## Nomenclature

- When energy is stored in the propellant, it is called "Fuel"
    - Not all propellants are fuels (noble gases)
    - Not all fuels are propellants (nuclear fuel rods)
- Total Expelled Propellant: $M_{\text{p}}$

## Effectiveness

- Called "Effectiveness" not "Efficiency"
    - Effectiveness: Less mathemaatically rigorous
    - Efficiency: Thoroughly defined
- Effectiveness: $\eta$

## Chemically

- Start from [[energy-conservation#jet-power-equation | jet equation]]:
    - $P_{\text{jet}} = \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} u_{e}^{2} = \eta \dot{E}$
- Note the specific energy of the fuel itself:
    - Specific Energy: $\epsilon$
    - $\dot{E} = \epsilon \dot{m}$
- Thus: $\frac{1}{2} u_{e}^{2} = \eta \epsilon$
