- The most important laws (a.k.a. the ones he told us about in class)
    - #1: "Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion."
    - #3: "Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time."
- For more, see Dr. Akin's [website](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html)
- From a symposium Akin attended at MIT: "The future of Aerospace Engineering is Systems Engineering, whatever that is ðŸ˜†"
