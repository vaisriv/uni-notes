# Uni Notes - UMD

This site contains my notes from my studies as an Undergraduate Aerospace Engineering Major and Physics Minor at the [University of Maryland: College Park](https://umd.edu/).

This site was generated using [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/), all notes were written in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and diagrams were either sourced online or created using [Excalidraw](https://example.com) or by hand.
