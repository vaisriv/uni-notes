title: Uni Notes
---

This site contains my notes from my studies as an Undergraduate Aerospace Engineering Major and Physics Minor at the [University of Maryland: College Park](https://umd.edu/).

These notes are organized via a combination of a `Year/Class/Lecture <Date>` directory structure and the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) Method. As such, all of the information contained within these notes can be accessed via either sidebar navigation or through the search functionality. I use the aforementioned directory structure to organize my notes, and the [zk](https://zk-org.github.io/zk/) command-line tool to interact with them on a daily basis.

This site was generated using [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/). All notes were written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and are stored in a [git](https://git-scm.com/) repository, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/vaisriv/uni-notes). The diagrams were either sourced online, created using [Excalidraw](https://example.com), or drawn by hand.
