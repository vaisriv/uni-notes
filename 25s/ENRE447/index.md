# Fundamentals of Reliability Engineering

Provides a general survey of the techniques of reliability engineering with a focus on theoretical basis and quantitative methods, with frequent examples of application. Topics include mathematical definition of reliability, probabilistic models to represent failure phenomena, statistical life models for non-repairable components, reliability data analysis, failure modes and effects analysis, risk analysis, and system reliability models including fault trees, event trees. Students will learn how to apply these techniques to problems related to engineering systems, with example cases for process plants, energy systems and infrastructure.
